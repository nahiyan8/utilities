utils
=====

A repository of useful utilities you'll thank me for.

A summary of the utilities in this repo:
	root.cpp: Gets the square-root of a given integer using the Babylonian method.
	bitstore.{cpp,hpp}: Stores bits, sort of compressed in bytes. (8 bits per byte usage, instead of using normal bools)

I'm trying to find my llist (linked list) class, I can't seem to.. I think I lost it in a backup or something..
