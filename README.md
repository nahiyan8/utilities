C[++] utilities
===============

A repository of useful utilities you'll find cool. Also micro-optimised. (Stop hating me for that!)

A summary of the utilities in this repo:
- llist.hpp: An optimised linked list class.
- bitstore.{cpp,hpp}: Stores bits, sort of compressed in bytes. (8 bits per byte usage, instead of using normal bools)
- functions.cpp: A number of functions that you may need, eg, an array moving function (simple), or a find function.

Please suggest improvements or bugs or stuff on the issues page! It would help me a lot. (readability is already on the list)
